Running the code:

1) Unzip the folder (eg: c:\desktop)
2) Open matlab and browse to the unzipped folder (This is to set the curret directory as working directory)
3) Open and run Puzzle8.m

Notes:

1) Nodes.txt, nodePath.txt and NodesInfo.txt files will be generated in current working directory.
2) The Code takes ~143 seconds to generate all possible nodes
3) If there is no solution, the code will iterate through all possible nodes and then exit with message that the is no solution
4) The code runs the output GUI at the end if there is a solution
